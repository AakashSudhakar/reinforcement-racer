# Reinforcement Racer Project Challenges

---

This file is your **single-source-of-truth** for accessing relevant challenges and tasks required to complete the Reinforcement Racer project. 

Please read through this document exhaustively and make sure you have a fundamental understanding of the range and type of tasks you're required to complete for successful project completion. 

## PROGRESSIVE CHALLENGES

The first major benchmark of successful project performance is being able to run the project successfully and understand the basics of its architecture and hierarchy.

**Navigate to `project.py` and `structures/structures.py`: answer all relevant _TODOs_ to complete the first part of the project.**

## ANALYTIC CHALLENGES

Once you've successfully ran and interpreted your project once, you'll perform some additional challenges flexing both your working knowledge of reinforcement-learning-based artificial intelligence as well as your experience in software engineering and computer science. 

### Objective 1: Configured Hyperparameter Optimization

Remember that odd little configuration file we have? The one named `config.txt`? 

This is your chance to get a better understanding of what the file is and how to manipulate it to improve your abilities in reinforcement learning.

Navigate to the `config.txt` file and perform **at least five** different hyperparameter tunings, changing up discretized values within reason. 

Be sure to make use of official NEAT documentation for what type of hyperparameters and information is embedded within the file, [as provided via this link](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html).

Finally, create a new subdirectory in your project directory called `tuning/`; after running _at least twenty (20) generations_ for each of your tuned hyperparameter cases, save the final accuracy report (as produced by your terminal) as an image within the `tuning/` folder.

If all is done correctly, you should be left with a new subdirectory called `tuning/` that contains at least five (5) new screenshotted images on your hyperparameter optimization task.
